- Both of these graphs show the most used negative word. 
- The word cloud allows you to see what the words are but the bar graph allows you to see how much 
- I used a max of 60 words in the word cloud so it would fit on the screen
- I used top_n(20) in my bar graph so you can tell what the total negative words are
- Debts and incorrect are the most common words
- Not many issues are repeated

2. shows the bottom 20 sentiment companies

- Combined postive and negative words
- I used "bing" to figure out the total sentiment
- I took the lowest 20 for the bar graph to show the companies with the worst sentiment top_n(-20)
- Experian has the worst score under -2000
- multiple companies are negative

 relate

- In the input section the user has to choose up to 20 companies that they want to see 
- 20 is the limit so the data isn't clustered
- In the output section of the code I have the graph changing based on what the user inputs by using input$n
- I used a bar graph because I thought it was the easiest way to see the total number of issues for each company
- Bank of America is the leader in complaints
- The companies that have complaints is a lot closer then the type of complaints
- different companies get the same kind of complaints
