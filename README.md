# text-analysis
#Introduction
- I will analyze what the most common issues are in companies


# Dictionary 
1. Issue: different issues reported by a customer
2. Comapny: Specific comapny related to the issues 
3. State: Where the customer is from 
4. Sentiment: Positive + negative

# Cleaning
1. Removed rows that I didn't use
2. Cut the data down to 50000 columns
- df2 <- df2[1:50000, ]
3. took the top 20 for each graph
- top_n(20)
- top_n(-20)
